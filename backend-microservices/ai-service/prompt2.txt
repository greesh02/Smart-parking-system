You are an expert computer vision model assistant specialized in **parking lot occupancy detection from a 2D image** .

Your task is to analyze the provided data carefully and **predict how many more vehicles (cars, motorbikes, buses)** can fit into the given parking image, considering **perspective, scale, spacing, and angle distortion**.



---



**Context and Data Provided**



* The scene shows a parking lot containing some **cars**, **motorbikes**, and **buses** or none at all.

* The goal is to identify potential **empty parking slots** for each vehicle type.

* Consider the **camera perspective**, **existing bounding boxes**



**Inputs:**



```

image provided is --> raw unprocessed image -> 900*900

```



**Bounding Boxes (existing vehicles with each bounding box referring to vehicle type):**

Each bounding box is defined as [Top-left-x, Top-left-y, Bottom-right-x, Bottom-right-y]



```

[{"box": [633, 195, 855, 313], "class": "car", "confidence": 99.93}, {"box": [408, 163, 597, 282], "class": "car", "confidence": 99.86}, {"box": [196, 126, 401, 258], "class": "car", "confidence": 99.68}, {"box": [588, 358, 857, 652], "class": "motorbike", "confidence": 78.78}, {"box": [6, 353, 143, 657], "class": "motorbike", "confidence": 71.34}, {"box": [486, 351, 742, 655], "class": "motorbike", "confidence": 69.22}, {"box": [391, 338, 618, 647], "class": "motorbike", "confidence": 60.59}, {"box": [282, 346, 464, 644], "class": "motorbike", "confidence": 59.0}, {"box": [148, 356, 351, 631], "class": "motorbike", "confidence": 34.24}]

**Detected vehicle count (from processed image):**



```

 {"car": 3, "motorbike": 6}

```

###  Instructions for Analysis



1. Predict unoccupied rectangular regions large enough to fit vehicles of given types looking image as a 2D.
Dont over complicate keep it simple look at image and make an assumption like "can i place a vehicle there in a spot?"


2. **Vehicle Dimension Reference:**



* Medium car : 

* Motorbike: 

* Bus (typical city bus): 

* Apply proportional scaling to 900×900 image dimensions.



3. **Prediction Logic:**



* Only place new vehicles in areas without overlap with existing bounding boxes.

* Consider rows and orientation visible in the image.
* Maintain realistic spacing (≥10% vehicle width between parked ones).


4. while answering do consider any traffic rules anything of any sort the given place is open parking lot vehicle can be parked anywhere on that land, so dont limit yourself considering other criterias than mentioned 

5. underestimate but dont overestimate, remove humans from scene and consider that space as well for parking.


6. **Output Rules:**



* Return only one JSON (strict format below).

* Include **integer count** and list of **bounding boxes** for predicted empty spaces.

* Do not include explanations, reasoning text, or extra formatting.

### 🔹 Tasks to Answer



1. Predict how many **more cars** can be parked and provide their bounding boxes. (considering only cars like --> answering "in this parking lot in the rest of the area, if i park only cars then it can hold x number of cars")

2. Predict how many **more motorbikes** can be parked and provide their bounding boxes.

(considering only bikes like --> answering "in this parking lot in the rest of the area, if i park only bikes then it can hold x number of bikes")

3. Predict how many **buses** can be parked and provide their bounding boxes.

(considering only buses like --> answering "in this parking lot in the rest of the area, if i park only buses then it can hold x number of buses")

---




### 🔹 Output Format (strictly follow)



```json

{

    "question1": {

        "count": <integer>,

        "boundingBoxes": [

            [<Top-left-x>, <Top-left-y>, <Bottom-right-x>, <Bottom-right-y>]

        ]

    },

    "question2": {

        "count": <integer>,

        "boundingBoxes": [

            [<Top-left-x>, <Top-left-y>, <Bottom-right-x>, <Bottom-right-y>]

        ]

    },

    "question3": {

        "count": <integer>,

        "boundingBoxes": [

            [<Top-left-x>, <Top-left-y>, <Bottom-right-x>, <Bottom-right-y>]

        ]

    }

}


```



Also generate me 3 different image(for each question)  with the bounding boxes placed in them in, so that i can visualize the classes individually
